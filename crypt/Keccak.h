================================================================
The purpose of this source file is to demonstrate a readable and compact
implementation of all the Keccak instances approved in the FIPS 202 standard,
including the hash functions and the extendable-output functions (XOFs).

We focused on clarity and on source-code compactness,
rather than on the performance.

The advantages of this implementation are:
    + The source code is compact, after removing the comments, that is. :-)
    + There are no tables with arbitrary constants.
    + For clarity, the comments link the operations to the specifications using
        the same notation as much as possible.
    + There is no restriction in cryptographic features. In particular,
        the SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 XOFs can produce any output length.
    + The code does not use much RAM, as all operations are done in place.

The drawbacks of this implementation are:
    - There is no message queue. The whole message must be ready in a buffer.
    - It is not optimized for performance.

The implementation is even simpler on a little endian platform. Just define the
LITTLE_ENDIAN symbol in that case.
